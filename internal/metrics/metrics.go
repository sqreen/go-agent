// Package metrics provides shared metrics stores. A metrics store is a
// key/value store with a given time period after which the data is considered
// ready. This package provides an implementation optimized for writes updating
// already existing keys: lots of goroutines updating a smaller set of keys.
// The metrics engine allows to create and register new metrics stores that a
// single reader (Sqreen's agent) can concurrently read. Read and write
// operations and mutually exclusive - slow polling is better for aggregating
// more data while not blocking the writers too often.
//
// Main requirements:
//
// - Loss-less kv-stores.
// - Near zero time impact on the hot path (updates): no need to switch to
//   another goroutines, no blocking locks.
//
// Design decisions:
//
// The former first implementation was using channels and dedicated goroutines
// sleeping until the period was passed. The major issue was the case when
// the channels were full, with the choice of either blocking the sending
// goroutine, or dropping the data to avoid blocking it.
// This design is now considered not suitable for metrics as they happen at a
// too frequently to go through a channel. A channel indeed needs at least one
// extra reader goroutine that would require too much CPU time to aggregate
// all the metrics values.
//
// Metrics store operations, insertions and updates of integer values, are
// therefore considered shorter than any "pure-Go" approach with channels and
// so on. The main challenge here comes from the map whose index cannot be
// modified concurrently. So the idea is to use a RWLock it in order to
// mutually exclude the insertions of new values, updates of existing values and
// retrieval of expired values.
// The hot path being updates of existing values, the Add() method first tries
// to only RLock the store in order to avoid locking every other
// updating-goroutine. The value being a uint64, it can be atomically updated
// without using an lock for the value.
//
// The metrics stores and engine provide a polling interface to retrieve stores
// whose period are passed. No goroutine is started to automatically swap the
// stores. This is due to the fact that metrics are sent by the Sqreen agent
// only during the heartbeat; it can therefore check for expired stores.
// Metrics stores can therefore be longer than their period and will actually
// last until they are flushed by the reader goroutine.
