# Docker image examples

This example allows to create a docker image of Go web server with Sqreen.

## Examples

The following Dockerfile examples show-case multi-stage docker images in order
to separate the build environment and the tools it needs, from the production
application image.

They all use the official [golang docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang)
which contains by default everything required to compile a Go program with
Sqreen.

### Building the image examples

#### Building the debian docker image example

The Dockerfile of this example can be found in the `debian/` subdirectory.
It shows how to produce a debian docker image with the Go web server
protected by Sqreen.

Build the docker image and tag it with the image name `hello-sqreen` by doing:

```console
examples/docker $ docker build -t hello-sqreen -f debian/Dockerfile .
```

#### Building the Alpine docker image example

The Dockerfile of this example can be found in the `alpine/` subdirectory.
It shows how to produce an alpine docker image with the Go web server
protected by Sqreen.

Build the docker image and tag it with the image name `hello-sqreen` by doing:

```console
examples/docker $ docker build -t hello-sqreen -f alpine/Dockerfile .
```

#### Building the scratch docker image example

The Dockerfile of this example can be found in the `scratch/` subdirectory.
It shows how to produce a docker from scratch with the Go web server protected
by Sqreen.

Build the docker image and tag it with the image name `hello-sqreen` by doing:

```console
examples/docker $ docker build -t hello-sqreen -f scratch/Dockerfile .
```

### Running the docker image

Once you have built your `hello-sqreen` docker image by following one of the
previous docker build examples, you can then run it.

1. Create the application on our dashboard and get its credentials at <https://my.sqreen.com/new-application>

1. Run the docker image with Sqreen by at least passing the Sqreen application
   token:
   ```console
   examples/docker $ docker run -t -p 8080:8080 -e SQREEN_TOKEN="your token" -e SQREEN_APP_NAME="you app name" --rm hello-sqreen
   ```
   See the [configuration](https://docs.sqreen.com/go/configuration/) for the
   full list of configuration options.

Congratulations, your are running a Go web server now protected by Sqreen!
