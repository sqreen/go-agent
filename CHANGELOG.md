# v0.1.0-beta.4

This release adds the ability to block IP addresses or users into your Go web
services by adding support for [Security Automation] according to your
[playbooks] and their configured security responses.

Note that redirecting users or IP addresses is not supported yet.

## New Feature

- [Security Automation]:  
  It is now possible to block IP addresses or users. When a [playbook]
  triggers, the agent is notified and gets the batch of security responses.
  They are asynchronously stored into data structures optimized for fast lookup
  and low memory usage. Middleware functions can thus perform fast lookups to
  block requests in a few microseconds in order to exit request handlers as
  fast as possible.

  - Blocking IP addresses:  
    No changes are required to block IP addresses. Our middleware functions
    have been updated to block requests whose IP addresses match a security
    response. The request is aborted with HTTP status code `500` and Sqreen's
    default HTML information page.
  
  - Blocking users:   
    Blocking users is performed by combining SDK methods `Identify()` and
    `MatchSecurityResponse()` in order to firstly associate a user to the
    current request, and secondly to check if it matches a security response.
    When a security response matches, the request handler and any related
    goroutines should be stopped as soon as possible.
    
    Usage example:
    ```go
    uid := sdk.EventUserIdentifiersMap{"uid": "my-uid"}
    sqUser := sdk.FromContext(ctx).ForUser(uid)
    sqUser.Identify()
    if match, err := sqUser.MatchSecurityResponse(); match {
      // Return now to stop further handling the request and let Sqreen's
      // middleware apply the configured security response and abort the
      // request. The returned error may help aborting from sub-functions by
      // returning it to the callers when the Go error handling pattern is
      // used.
      return err
    }
    ```
    
    We strongly recommend to create a user-authentication middleware function
    in order to seamlessly integrate user-blocking to all your
    user-authenticated endpoints.

## Fix

- Escape the event type name to avoid JSON marshaling error. Note that this
  case could not happen in previous agent versions. (#52)

## Minor Change

- Avoid performing multiple times commands within the same command batch. (51)


# v0.1.0-beta.3

## New Features

- Get the client IP address out of the HAProxy header `X-Unique-Id` using the
  new configuration variable `ip_header_format`. (#41)

- New configuration option `strip_http_referer`/`SQREEN_STRIP_HTTP_REFERER`
  allowing to avoid sending the `Referer` HTTP header to the Sqreen backend when
  it contains sensitive data. (#36)

- Ability to disable/enable the agent through the [dashboard
  settings](https://my.sqreen.com/application/goto/settings/global) using the
  Sqreen status button. (#29)

## Breaking Changes

- Agent internals are now under a private Go package and can no longer be
  imported. Any sub-package under `github.com/sqreen/go-agent/agent` was not
  supposed to be imported and is now private to avoid future confusions. (#27)

## Fixes

- Remove duplicate `User-Agent` entry sent twice in the request record. (#42)

- Fix IPv4 and IPv6 matching against private network definitions. (#38)

- Remove useless empty request records mistakenly created while not carrying
  any SDK observation. (#38)

## Minor Changes

- Better memory management and footprint when the agent is disabled by removing
  globals. This will be also required to be able to cleanly restart the agent by
  self-managing the initializations. (#28)


# v0.1.0-beta.2

## New feature

- Add a new `Identify()` method allowing to explicitly associate a user to the
current request. As soon as we add the support for the security reponses, it
will allow to block users (#26).

# v0.1.0-beta.1

This version is a new major version towards the v0.1.0 as it proposes a new and
stable SDK API, that now will only be updated upon user feedback. So please,
share your impressions with us.

## New Features

- New web framework middleware support:
  - Standard Go's `net/http` package (#21).
  - Echo (#19).

- Multiple custom events can now be easily associated to a user using the
  user-scoped methods under `ForUser()`. For example, to send two custom events
  for a given user, do:

    ```go
    sqUser := sqreen.ForUser(uid)
    sqUser.TrackEvent("my.event.one")
    sqUser.TrackEvent("my.event.two")
    ```

- The configuration file can now be stored into multiple locations, the current
  working directory or the executable one, or enforced using the new
  configuration environment variable `SQREEN_CONFIG_FILE` (#25).

- The custom client IP header configured in `SCREEN_IP_HEADER` is now also sent
  to Sqreen so that it can better understand what IP headers were considered by
  the agent to determine what is the actual client IP address
  (67e2d4cbf9b883e9e91e1a5d9e53348a18c1b900).

## Breaking Changes

- Stable SDK API of "Sqreen for Go":

  - Avoid name conflicts with framework packages by prefixing Sqreen's
    middleware packages with `sq`. For example, `gin` becomes `sqgin` (#17).

  - Cleaner Go documentation now entirely included in the SDK and middleware
    packages Go documentations. So no more need to go inside the agent
    documentation to know more on some SDK methods, it is now all documented
    in the same place, with lot of examples.

  - Clearer SDK API: The flow of security events that can send to Sqreen is
    now well-defined by a tree of SDK methods that can only be used the right
    way. (#18, #24)

     - The SDK handle getter function name is renamed from
       `GetHTTPRequestContext()` into a simpler `FromContext()`.

     - User-related SDK methods are now provided by `ForUser()`, for example:

         ```go
         sqreen.TrackAuth(true, uid)
         ```

       becomes

         ```go
         sqreen.ForUser(uid).TrackAuthSuccess()
         ```


# v0.1.0-alpha.5

## New features

- sdk: user-related security events:
      - ability to associate a user to an event using `WithUserIdentifier()` (#13).
      - track user creation using `TrackSignup()` (#15).
      - track user authentication using `TrackAuth()` (#15).
    
- agent/backend: take into account `{HTTPS,HTTP,NO}_PROXY` environment variables (and their lowercase alternatives) (#14).
    
- agent/backend: share the organization token for all your apps (#12).

## Fixes

- agent/config: avoid conflicts with global viper configs (#16).
- sdk: better documentation with examples.
